# Auto ChimeIn Extension (Firefox)

![Here is a demo video to help you understand the purpose](https://youtu.be/DcpC5HAPtK8)

This extension will automatically select the (first) correct answer to a ChimeIn question when enabled. It can also be configured to send pings to a Discord Webhook. 

I plan to add Discord pings with no auto selection
